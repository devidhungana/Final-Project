# Final Project
The assignment was to create a personal resume website. I mostly used CSHTML file to write HTML codes to create a resume. We didn't really play with net FRAMERWORK during the course, so I was very uncomfortable to use it to create a resume. So for personal ease I used asp.net core to create it. The screenshots of the resume is provide under screenshot directory, the screenshot was taken right after I ran the code. There are three screenshots of resume because it couldn't fit on the single screenshot.
